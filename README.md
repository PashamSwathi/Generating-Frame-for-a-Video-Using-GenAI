Generating Frame for a Video Using GenAI

This project transforms video content into images using AI, starting with downloading video from youtube,audio extraction and ending with image generation.
Extracts key insights from the video by analyzing audio transcripts and generating summaries.
Leveraged AI models such as T5, BART, Pegasus and GPT to shorten summaries and for image creation.
Utilized OpenAI DALLE for image generation by using the summaries obtained from different AI models. Need to give input OpenAI api secret key which is different for everyone.
This Research demonstrates the potential of AI in automating and enhancing multimedia content creation, marketing and with applications in various fields.
